# VoiceBot Fixes Applied

## Issue: Duplicate Speech/Talking Over Each Other
### Root Causes:
1. Multiple handlers for the same transcript events
2. Both `transcription` and `response.audio_transcript.done` events adding same text
3. No deduplication logic for transcript display

### Fixes Applied:
1. **rtc.js**: 
   - Separated delta updates from final transcripts
   - Added `lastTranscript` tracking to prevent duplicates
   - Clear accumulated transcript after final message
   - UpdateAssistantTranscript now properly accumulates text

2. **app.js**:
   - Removed duplicate `response.audio_transcript.delta` handler
   - Added `stopAllAudio()` before playing new audio
   - Added `isInterrupted` flag to prevent audio accumulation
   - 50ms delay between stopping and starting audio

## Issue: No RAG/API Calling in RTC Mode
### Root Cause:
RTC client was missing handlers for function calls and results

### Fixes Applied:
1. **rtc.js**:
   - Added handlers for `function_call` and `function.result`
   - Added `playAudioResponse` method
   - Displays function calls in UI
   - Shows document count when RAG search completes

2. **server.py**:
   - Added `/rtc` endpoint with full function support
   - RTC mode gets same tools as regular mode
   - Function calls properly forwarded to RTC clients
   - Fixed import for base64

## Current Model Configuration
- Using: `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`
- Ready to upgrade to: `gpt-realtime` when available
- Voice: `alloy` (normal speech speed)

## How to Test

1. **Restart the server** to apply all changes:
```bash
./restart_server.sh
# OR manually:
pkill -f "python src/server.py"
python src/server.py
```

2. **Test RTC Mode**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000/rtc.html
   - Upload product_catalog.json
   - Say "Search for security products"
   - Verify: No duplicate responses, RAG search works

3. **Test Regular Mode**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Test interruption by speaking while AI is responding
   - Verify: Audio stops immediately, no overlapping speech

## Files Modified
- `src/server.py`: Added base64 import, function call forwarding
- `public/rtc.js`: Fixed duplicate transcripts, added RAG handlers
- `public/app.js`: Fixed audio overlap, removed duplicate handlers
